## Flipper

#### The Story

A traveling "circus" is in town for the next week or two. The circus puts on high attendance shows that feature highly trained, Awakened, and/or chimera animals. There are rumors that this circus has been mistreating some of their animals, but the circus does its best to hide and/or dismiss these rumors (i.e. the runners will have to find this out from legwork).

#### The Job

The Johnson, representing either a wealthy client or an aquatic corporation like Proteus AG (GM's choice), wants the runners to steal one of the circus' animals, specifically an incredibly intelligent and well-trained dolphin named Kumo.

#### The Catch

Kumo is not only highly intelligent and well-trained, but he's also secretly a Flipper, i.e. he's an Emerged animal, and that's actually why the Johnson wants him. If sprung peacefully, he will initially think the runners are trying to free him, but if he picks up the fact that he's going to be given over to another owner and/or the runners are mean to and/or hurt him, he will warn his trainer (via Matrix) and do technocritter bullshit to mess up the team. There are also potentially lots of interesting critters in the circus who could mess with the runners' neatly laid-out plans.

#### The Memorable Reward

If the Johnson gets Kumo, he will provide the team with a few doses of a special drug harvested from Awakened seaweed. When orally ingested, the drug allows the user to breathe underwater as if they had gills, and it lasts for 4+(Essence) hours.
I especially like this setup because it implies that Animal Handling and Pilot Watercraft both become incredibly important. Flippers are one of the few Technocritters that have enough powers and dice to not be pushovers, but because they're aquatic, PCs are less likely to be able to use of them for more power.

## Break repetitive tactics

#### The Story

An organization (GM's choice) has come into possession of a mysterious package, which is being held at a secure warehouse.

#### The Job

The Johnson wants the mysterious package stolen and delivered to a dead drop untampered and unopened. He will pay extra if the entire run gets filmed from the perspective of the runners, preferably via simrig, and the more runners who agree to film the run, the better the payment. If pressed or light legwork is performed, the runners are informed that this is all a reality trid that has the angle of being as authentic as possible, which is why the Johnson is very coy about why they need the run recorded as much as possible.

#### The Catch

The mysterious box is a dud, the Johnson actually works for the organization who owns the warehouse, and the run is actually a security/penetration test to make sure the warehouse really is secure for when the real package turns up. Unless the runners go digging deep, they will not know that this is all a test run, and depending on how much legwork is done, they should think that it's either a regular run or a reality trid show. However, a few weeks/months later, the runners are forcefully hired (read: they cannot afford to reject the job) by a different Johnson to infiltrate the same warehouse for something actually valuable, only to find that the warehouse really is prepared for their every move. The more they filmed of their original run, the more things the warehouse security is prepared for. Examples include drones to detect invisible people (drones roll object resistance to resist mental manipulation spells), wards to keep out spirits and foci, extra security measures to catch social engineers off guard, extra traps in unexpected places to keep out physical infiltrators, blast doors at strategic locations to slow down forceful entry to give HTR more time to arrive, and a technomancer with registered sprites both to monitor the Matrix and to use Gremlins on the runners' devices.

#### The Memorable Reward

After the first job, the Johnson will put them in contact with a talent scout or media personality, reinforcing or revealing (depending on how much legwork the runners did) the red herring that this was all a reality trid. After the second job, the runners can get a memorable reward depending on who they are hired by.

## Kids moral

#### The Story

The Matrix is a dangerous place for many reasons, one of them being that many of the most proficient in the matrix are quite young, immature and often not entirely aware of the wider consequences of their actions. This often means childish spats between two skilled users can spill out into the real world and have very real consequences for real people, who occasionally have very powerful friends, or in this case, family.

#### The Job

Mr Johnson is a corporate suit, well dressed and seemingly well accustomed to dealing with runners, knowing both the proper place to meet and the proper social graces necessary. Any legwork leads to it coming out he's a well respected and connected fixer who often facilitates a lot of work for (insert locally prominent AAA). The job simply involves tracking down a decker and putting a bullet in them. Mr Johnson stresses the respectable payday (definitely nothing to scoff at for even an established team of runners), the potentiality for further work down the road, the ease of the job (find the nerd, shoot them, it can't be that hard) and the general low character of the decker in question (they have been involved in cyber attacks that have left people with lasting nerve damage, irreparably ruined people's credit and other such things). If the job is taken he leaves them with one of the decker's many handles and says contact him when they have proof of the kill.

The process of tracking down the decker involves a good deal of legwork, with the best results coming from working contacts in hacker collectives, matrix gangs and similar groups who know a good deal about the decker in question. They are well known as a rising star in the competitive hacking community for their skill, reclusiveness and general dickishness towards those they dislike, often frying decks and cooking brains after being challenged, mocked or slighted. Play up that this person is dangerous and finding them wont be the hardest part of their job.

Eventually (potentially after greasing palms with favours or Nuyen) the runners are able to track down a now retired rigger who got their nerves a little fried while on a run with this decker after an altercation broke out between them. The rigger tracked the decker's location before he just jacked out for his own health's sake. The rigger has been recovering in a street clinic for the last few weeks.

Heading to the decker's location leads to a tiny apartment in whatever middle class area exists in the city you're gaming in, where the decker is found.

#### The Catch

The Decker is a 15 year old girl attending a local community college (she skipped some grades, she's very bright) who is a hardcore sim-junkie. Her apartment is full of endearingly dorky fan merch, family pictures, and knick-knacks. She is fully jacked in and totally unaware when the PCs arrive. Play it up, make the PCs uncomfortable and feel bad about themselves. They're killing an entirely defenceless person.
To me the appeal of this run is that the "bossfight" isn't some climactic combat encounter or dice heavy social interaction. It's really just a moral quandary that should hopefully lead to a lot of in-character debate and disagreement, with the added pressure that they have no idea if the decker they're after will jack out at any moment.

## Kidnapping ?

#### The Story

Ms. Johnson is a wealthy aristocrat whose daughter has been kidnapped and the contents of her bank account withdrawn. Her last known whereabouts were somewhere in the Downtown district where her commlink signal was last registered.

#### The Job

The Johnson wants her daughter back, the money retrieved, and the kidnappers to be terminated with extreme prejudice. As one with high standing in the city, nobody sullies her good name.

#### The Catch

The Johnson's daughter wasn't kidnapped - she ran away from home, taking the money in her account with her in a fraudulent heist. The 'kidnapper' is the leader of a go-gang up in Everett. They've apparently been seeing each other for months through the only means they had available - they're both Awakened mages, and they've been sneaking off at night into the astral plane.
